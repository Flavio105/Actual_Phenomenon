## Usage

### Chatbot Integration

To integrate a chatbot, you can use the provided templates. Follow these steps:

1. **Configure the Chatbot**: Modify the configuration files as per your requirements.
2. **Start the Chatbot**: Use the command below to run the chatbot service.

   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

3. **Interact**: Use the API endpoints to send messages and receive responses.

### Data Management with ChromaDB

ChromaDB allows for efficient data management. To use it:

1. **Set Up ChromaDB**: Ensure ChromaDB is running.
2. **Connect**: Use the provided connection strings to connect your application to ChromaDB.
3. **Perform Operations**: Use the API to perform CRUD operations on your data.

### Embeddings with Sentence Transformers

To utilize sentence transformers:

1. **Load the Model**: Load the desired sentence transformer model.
2. **Generate Embeddings**: Use the model to generate embeddings for your text data.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('model_name')
embeddings = model.encode(['Your text here'])
```
